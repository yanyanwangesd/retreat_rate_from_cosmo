# retreat_rate_from_cosmo
This program calculates directional mass flux (retreat rate) from detrital cosmogenic 10Be concentrations. 
The theory is published on Wang, Y. and Willett, S. D.: Escarpment retreat rates derived from detrital cosmogenic nuclide concentrations, Earth Surf. Dynam., 9, 1301â€“1322, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-9-1301-2021, 2021.

To use this program, you will need all the functions from the master branch and TopoToolBox (a MATLAB-based topographic analysis toolbox, please download it from https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/download/). Please look up the wiki pages on the left pannel to have an idea about using this programe.

Technical help is possible, please contact via wangyanyan0607@hotmail.com.
