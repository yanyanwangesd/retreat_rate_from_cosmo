This programe calculates directional mass flux from detrital cosmogenic 10Be concentrations. 

The theory is published on Wang, Y. and Willett, S. D.: Escarpment retreat rates derived from detrital cosmogenic nuclide concentrations, Earth Surf. Dynam., 9, 1301â€“1322, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-9-1301-2021, 2021.

To use this program, you will need all the functions from the master branch and TopoToolBox (a MATLAB-based topographic analysis toolbox, please download it from https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/download/). Please look up the wiki pages on the left pannel to have an idea about using this programe.




If you use this programe in your work, please cite our paper. 

Regular maintainer: Dr. Yanyan Wang (yanyan.wang@erdw.ethz.ch), technichal help is provided, discussions are welcome.
